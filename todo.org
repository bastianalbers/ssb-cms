Implement renderers (for text, images) that can be switched
into "edit mode". In this mode, they implement a simple interface for chaning
the content and committing a new revision.
    - [ ] image (drop target), a message containing a blob link, width,
      height and, optionally, a position
    - [ ] markdown text, a message with properties named after ISO language
      codes. In edit mode, all language versions can be edited.
